        <p>I created this site to help individuals of the LGBTQI+ commmunity to begin there journey to their recovery. This site will give numerous resources from detoxes,programs as well as meeting and life coaches. Many people struggle with addiction and want to take that first step on that path but have no idea of what to do or where to go. Luckily Massachusetts has many resources , however there is no one stop shop type of site out there so I wanted to change that so that is how It is never too late became into excitances. This site will give many resources as well as discriptions of what each resources is and who they are attended for.</p>
